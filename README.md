# Graphics-User-Interface-in-C-and-Plotting-Using-Qt-QCustomPlot-and-Eigen-Matrix-Library
This project demonstrates how to develop graphic user interfaces in C++ using the Qt development environment. Also, we demonstrate how to couple Eigen matrix library with QCustomPlot Qt library to generate graphs and plots in C++
